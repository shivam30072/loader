<h1>Routes</h1>

<h2>- It has two routes one for home page and other for showing users</h2>
<h2>- we move to user page by clicking on get user button on navbar</h2>

<h1>Folder Structure</h1>

<h2>- Inside SRC folder there is only one folder called Components which contains most of the components</h2>
<h2>- SRC folder contains app.jsx file which renders all the components</h2>
<h2>- background Image and loader svg is also present inside component folder as the project was small so didn't create another folder for images</h2>
