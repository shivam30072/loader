<h1>Routes</h1>

<h2>- It has two routes one for home page and other for showing users</h2>
<h2>- we move to user page by clicking on get user button on navbar</h2>

<h1>Folder Structure</h1>

<h2>- Inside SRC folder there is only one folder called Components which contains most of the components</h2>
<h2>- SRC folder contains app.jsx file which renders all the components and a index.css file which has all the styling</h2>
<h2>- background Image and loader svg is also present inside component folder as the project was small so didn't create another folder for images</h2>

<h1>flow of code<h1>

<h2>when someone clicks on get user Button it calls the API</h2>
<h2>An array called user stores all the data coming from the API and using props it goes to the user route</h2>
<h2>here in user page if user array is empty means api is not yet able to fetch data then it shows loader svg otherwise it shows the users</h2>
<h2>if you click on logo it empties the array means every time you go back to home page it empties the array and when you click on button it fetches the data</h2>

<h1>problem faced </h1>
